# Way-Cooler-mdlite
Way cooler finalized static site, built with material design lite, using angular (and possibly es6 later?)

# Plans for adding to site
1. Add angular code... will make routing much more concise and powerful
2. Add an easier interface for adding documentation pages? should support a much more complex design.Additionally, since the documentation will like likely be the largest part of the site, it might be a good idea to separate the documentation into its own site?
3. Currently, the pages are being separated into their own seperate files via php include, angular routing might make this better/ different.

# Explanation of current state of site
This project is still on the UI layout stage, will add angular directives next. Also need more info for site contents, awaiting planning in conjunction with way cooler devs
